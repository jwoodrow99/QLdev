# QLdev

This is the base project for the QLdev framework. This project includes both of the QL libraries for Dom manipulation and the DB library to work with localstorage. We have also included the p5.js library which gives you the ability to make very basic animations and interactive games. You can view the documentation for each of the libraries at the following links:

* [QLdom](https://github.com/jwoodrow99/QLdom)
* [QLdb](https://github.com/jwoodrow99/QLdb)
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## How to get started

The QLdev framework is designed to be as extendable as you like, but give you the most powerful tools with as little configuration as possible. We want you to focus on building applications rather than worry about complex syntax so to get started using this base project all you need to do is drag the ```index.html``` file to a new browser tab in google chrome, open the ```app.js``` file in a text editor (Notepad or VScode) and start writing your code. We have already created the QL classes in this file so you are all set to go. You can use the ```sketch.js``` file to work with the p5.js canvas. If at any point you want to dissable the p5 canvas, open the ```index.html``` file and comment out the line that says ```<div id="canvas"></div>```, you can do this by changing the line to this ```<!-- <div id="canvas"></div> -->```.

Happy coding!
